# Excursion – Codecademy Git Practice

This repository contains the **Excursion landing page project** from the Codecademy Git & GitHub course.

The exercise consists of building a simple static website using **HTML and CSS**, while focusing on using **Git to track every step of the development process**.

## What I practiced
- Creating a local project and initializing Git
- Making incremental commits while building the page
- Understanding the Git workflow (working directory, staging area, commits)
- Creating and linking a remote GitHub repository
- Pushing changes to GitHub
- Using both Git CLI and GitHub Desktop to organize and group changes logically
